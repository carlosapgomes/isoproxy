#!/usr/sbin/nft -f
#
# nftables egress filtering for isoproxy
#
# This ruleset restricts the isoproxy user to only DNS and HTTPS traffic,
# logging any other connection attempts for monitoring.
#
# Installation:
#   1. Get isoproxy UID: id -u isoproxy
#   2. Update ISOPROXY_UID below with the actual UID
#   3. sudo cp deployment/nftables-isoproxy.conf /etc/nftables.d/isoproxy.conf
#   4. Include in main config:
#      echo 'include "/etc/nftables.d/isoproxy.conf"' | sudo tee -a /etc/nftables.conf
#   5. sudo nft -f /etc/nftables.conf
#   6. Verify: sudo nft list ruleset | grep isoproxy
#
# Monitoring:
#   Watch for blocked traffic: sudo journalctl -kf | grep isoproxy-blocked
#
# Testing:
#   sudo -u isoproxy curl https://api.anthropic.com  # should work
#   sudo -u isoproxy curl http://example.com         # should fail (HTTP)
#   sudo -u isoproxy nc -v 1.1.1.1 80               # should fail (port 80)
#

# Get the isoproxy user ID
# Run: id -u isoproxy
define ISOPROXY_UID = 999

# Optional: Restrict DNS to known-good resolvers (recommended for paranoid setups)
# Uncomment and customize based on your /etc/resolv.conf
# define DNS_SERVERS = {
#     1.1.1.1,      # Cloudflare Primary
#     1.0.0.1,      # Cloudflare Secondary
#     8.8.8.8,      # Google Primary
#     8.8.4.4,      # Google Secondary
